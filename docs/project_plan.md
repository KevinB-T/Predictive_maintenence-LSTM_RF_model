# Project Plan for Predictive Maintenance

## Overview
This project delivers a predictive maintenance solution for cold chain logistics using a hybrid LSTM + Random Forest model.

## Key Components
- **Data Simulation:** Kafka-based simulation for 10 reefer trucks.
- **Machine Learning:** Hybrid model training and inference.
- **Backend:** Flask API with AWS database integration.
- **Frontend:** React dashboard for real-time visualization.

## Timeline (6 months)
1. **Month 1-2:**  
   - Requirements gathering, system design, and initial prototyping.
2. **Month 3-4:**  
   - Data simulation, model development, and integration.
3. **Month 5:**  
   - Frontend dashboard development and API integration.
4. **Month 6:**  
   - Testing, optimization, and deployment.

## Deployment
- Dockerized services for consistent deployment.
- CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with real sensor hardware.
- Advanced anomaly detection and alerting.
